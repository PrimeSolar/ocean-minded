## Technologies Used 🛠️

&nbsp;&nbsp;I leverage modern technologies to provide you with a seamless online experience:

- **HTML5**: for structuring the web application, ensuring semantic markup and improved SEO.
- **CSS3**: for styling and layout, including responsive design techniques that enhance user experience across devices.
- **JavaScript**: for dynamic content updates and user interactions, providing a smooth and interactive experience.
- **Node.js**: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows me to execute JavaScript on the server side. It enables the development of scalable and high-performance applications, leveraging non-blocking I/O and an event-driven architecture to handle multiple connections simultaneously.
- **Express.js**: a Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the development process by offering a variety of middleware to handle requests, responses, and routing efficiently.
- **EJS**: a templating engine that allows me to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It enables dynamic content rendering on the server side, making it easy to create reusable templates and maintain a clean separation between my application logic and presentation.
